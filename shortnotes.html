 HTML Source File:
This is the raw code you write (or the browser receives) — it’s static and does not change on its own. It’s what you see when you right-click → View Page Source.
</p>
<p>
 DOM (Document Object Model):
This is what the browser builds in memory from the HTML source. It’s a live, dynamic tree structure that the browser uses to render the page.
You see the DOM when you inspect elements using developer tools.
</p>
<p>
    What happens when you modify DOM nodes in dev tools?
    When you edit HTML or CSS in the Elements tab of dev tools, you are changing the DOM directly — not the original HTML source.
    
    These changes only affect what you see in the browser at that moment.
    
    Once you refresh the page, the browser reloads the original HTML source, and all your DOM changes are lost.
    
    It’s great for testing changes quickly without editing the real code.

<p>
    GET:
    Sends data in the URL. It's used to request or retrieve data and is not secure for sensitive information.
</p>
<p>
    POST:
    Sends data in the request body. It's used to submit or send data securely, like forms or file uploads.
</p>
<p>
 Empty Required Fields:
If required fields are empty, the browser blocks the form submission and shows an error message until they are filled.
</p>
<p>
      Inline CSS
Written directly in the HTML tag.
example
<p style="color: red;">Text</p>

</p>
<p>
    Internal CSS

Written inside a style tag in the <head> section of HTML.
    example
    <style>
        p { color: blue; }
      </style>
      
</p>
<p>
    External CSS

Written in a separate .css file and linked using <link> tag.

Example:
<link rel="Stylesheet" href="StyleS.css">

    What is Responsive Design?
Responsive design means creating websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices (like phones, tablets, and desktops).
It ensures the layout looks good and usable no matter the screen size.

    Why is Mobile-First a Best Practice?
Most users access websites via mobile phones.

Designing for small screens first helps you focus on essential content and performance.

It’s easier to scale up for bigger screens than to shrink a large layout down.
